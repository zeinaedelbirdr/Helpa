## ⚙️ Core Architecture

| Component                | Purpose                                                             |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amazon EC2**           | Runs the image processing server using Node.js and Sharp            |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Routes user requests to the best available EC2 instance     |
| **Auto Scaling Group**   | Dynamically adds/removes instances based on real-time traffic       |
| **Amazon S3**            | Securely stores uploaded images and processed outputs               |
| **Amazon CloudFront** *(Optional)* | Distributes content globally for better performance          |
| **IAM Roles & Policies** | Secure access and controlled permissions for all AWS components     |
| **Amazon CloudWatch + SNS** | Monitors health metrics and sends alert notifications           |

## 🧭 Use Case Scenario

Imagine a user facing an issue with a UI component. They capture a screenshot, upload it through Helpa, and the platform automatically:

1. Compresses the image for faster sharing  
2. Resizes it for different support platforms  
3. Delivers a link-ready version optimized for mobile or desktop

Support agents can also use Helpa to preprocess images for documentation, tickets, or live chat.
